# AdamsLegacyBETA

Adam's Legacy is a branch of Popadam's Studio, where I create small indie games featuring Adam, our main hero, and his exciting adventures. In this version, I am developing a mini-game that includes enemies, boss fights, a coin system, and various tasks. I have also considered making it available online. Although the files may be a bit messy at the moment, I plan to refine them in the future.
Features Implemented so far:

    Simple collision system
    Basic character movements
    Uploaded map
    Created animations

Please note that this project is still a work in progress, and I will continue working on it to add more features and improvements. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Your contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
