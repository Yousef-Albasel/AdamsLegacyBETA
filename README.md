# Adam's Legacy

Adam's Legacy is a game of Popadam's Studio, where I create small indie games featuring Adam, our main hero, and his exciting adventures. In this version, I am developing a mini-game that includes enemies, boss fights, a coin system, and various tasks. I have also considered making it available online. Although the files may be a bit messy at the moment, I plan to refine them in the future.
## Features Implemented so far:

   - Simple collision system
   - Basic character movements
